            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                through daily experiences.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including
                early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other
                classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and
                on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the
                term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic
                field studying educational phenomena.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are
                disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination
                by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various
                forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural
                values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In
                doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized
                institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education
                policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements.
                International organizations, such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for
                all children.</p>
